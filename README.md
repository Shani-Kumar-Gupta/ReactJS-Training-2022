##What is React?  
> React is a **JavaScript Library**, created and developed by Facebook. It was released in the year 2011. React is a declarative, efficient and flexible ***JavaScript library for building user interfaces***. It let's you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called component.  

##Why React?
> - First of all, React is feature rich JavaScript Library, which comes with a lot of utility code that can be re-used in your application.
> - Second, it divides the UI into several small building block called as **Component**, and these component can be developed separately and independent of each other. In this way, it is more maintainable and easily testable.
> - The code which we write to implement a functionality with JavaScript, is drastically reduced when we write same functionality with React. In this way, development becomes faster and more productive.
